You can give any name you like\r\n\r\n* _stateKey_ - Optional attribute to output a specific `this.state[stateKey]` in each stage\r\n\r\n* _collapseBool_ - Optional boolean to collapse the console.groups\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    this.debug(\"slideShowImage\", \"currentImage\", false)\r\n\r\n### Notes ###\r\n\r\nOnly state is included as an optional attribute, because states are supposed to change a lot, whereas props should be changed sparingly. And only displaying one state key, will help devs to focus on one thing at a time.\r\nAlthough, because the groups are mosty spread across different component stages, anything console.logged in between will be visually nested inside these states, to get a good overview of what is happening.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
